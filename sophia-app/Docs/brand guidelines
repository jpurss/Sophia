RepOS Brand Guidelines


Brand Essence
Positioning: Your AI partner who makes you superhuman
Core Concept: Intelligence as revelation. A vast dark space with a pink door that sales reps walk through to see what others can't. Once inside, they have X-ray vision into every deal.
Metaphor: Taking the limitless drug. Seeing behind the curtain. The Matrix unplugged. Mission control at 2am.

Voice & Tone
Personality: Intelligent revelation with playful confidence
The Balance:
* 90% intelligent, revealing, direct
* 10% knowing wink, playful confidence
Guidelines
DO:
* Make them feel like they have X-ray vision
* Frame it as seeing the truth others miss
* "The dots were always there. Now you connect them."
* Intelligence as the unfair advantage
* Quiet confidence, not loud hype
* Occasional dry wit / knowing humor
* Self-aware about how powerful this is
DON'T:
* Dad jokes or puns
* Meme culture or trying too hard
* Self-deprecating (we're powerful, not apologetic)
* Cheerleading or motivation ("You can do it!")
* Breaking the "we know things" mystique
Example Copy
Good Examples:
* "See what your competition can't. (It's a lot.)"
* "Everyone's Googling. You're knowing."
* "The dots were always there. We just connected them. You're welcome."
* "That took you 30 seconds. Their team is still Googling."
* "Ready to see behind the curtain? (No going back.)"
Bad Examples:
* "Stop losing to competitors!"
* "You're already amazing!"
* "The revolutionary sales tool!"

Color System
Foundation (The Vastness)
Color	Hex	Usage
Deep Space	#0A0D14	Backgrounds, the void
Dark Navy	#0F1729	Elevated surfaces

Logo & Brand Mark
The Mark: R>
Structure:
* R: White (#FFFFFF) - The foundation, the user, the base
* >: Hot Pink (#FF006E) - The portal, the activation, the command
Meaning:
* R = You, the rep, the foundation
* > = The activation, the door through, the command prompt, forward momentum

Clear Space: Minimum padding of 1x the height of the R on all sides

* Print: 0.5 inches height
Lockups
* Primary: R> RepOS (mark + wordmark)
* Icon Only: R> (for app icons, favicons, social avatars)
* Wordmark Only: RepOS in Clash Display (when mark doesn't work)
Logo Don'ts
* ❌ Don't change colors (R and > must be white and pink)
* ❌ Don't rotate or skew
* ❌ Don't add effects, shadows, or outlines
* ❌ Don't place on busy backgrounds (use simple dark or light only)
* ❌ Don't recreate or retype - use official files

Visual Style
Core Aesthetic: The Intelligence Club
Concept: Dark, moody, exclusive-feeling but not gatekeepy. Like walking into a war room at 2am where the real decisions get made. Mission control vibes. You just got clearance.
Visual Principles
1. Dark > Light Always
* Default to dark backgrounds
* Light mode is not the priority
* Everything feels lit from within
2. Product is the Hero
* Show actual UI, not abstractions
* Real data (anonymized), not Lorem Ipsum
* Multiple interface states visible
* Command palette open showing power
3. Depth Through Layers
* Use the three dark colors to create elevation
* Subtle shadows that lift elements
* Glow effects on interactive elements
* Nothing flat - everything has depth
4. Generous Whitespace
* Even on dark, give elements room to breathe
* Centered, confident layouts
* Let the product float in the darkness
* Clean is smart
5. Subtle Motion
* Gentle animations, never jarring
* Glow pulses on CTAs
* Smooth transitions
* Feels alive but calm
Photography & Imagery
DO:
* ✅ Dark, moody product screenshots
* ✅ UI floating on dark backgrounds
* ✅ Glowing elements with subtle halos
* ✅ Real interface states with real data
* ✅ Command-driven workflows visible
* ✅ Multiple screens showing depth
DON'T:
* ❌ Stock photos of salespeople
* ❌ Bright, cheerful backgrounds
* ❌ Generic "collaboration" imagery
* ❌ Busy, cluttered layouts
* ❌ Anything that feels like every other SaaS site

* Background: Prussian (#003153)
* Border: None or 1px Dark Gray

Writing Style
Headlines
Brand Headlines (Clash Display):

* Can be provocative but never arrogant
* Often two lines with hierarchy (white + gray)
* Lead with benefit, not feature
Examples:
* "See what your competition can't."
* "Everyone's Googling. You're knowing."
* "Map Your Stakeholders. / Navigate Politics."
Body Copy
Tone: Direct, intelligent, occasionally playful
Structure:
* Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
* Second person ("you")
* Active voice
* Concrete over abstract
Examples:
* "Research that used to take 30 minutes? Done. (Seriously, 30 seconds.)"
* "The dots were always there. We just connected them. You're welcome."
* "Your competition sees a company. You see the system. Big difference."
Microcopy
Success States:
* "That took you 30 seconds. Their team is still Googling."
* "Three insights discovered. You're on a roll."
* "Well, that was easy."
Empty States:
* "Ready to see behind the curtain? (No going back.)"
* "What do you want to know? (And yes, we can find it.)"
* "Your first insight is 30 seconds away."
Error States:
* "Even we can't find that. (But we tried really hard.)"
* "Hmm. That's not supposed to happen. Give us a sec."
* "Plot twist: This one's actually private. Impressive security."
Loading States:

* "Finding what Google can't..."
